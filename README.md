 Collection of Python & AI-Based Applications
This repository contains a growing collection of my personal projects built using Python, AI/ML, Streamlit, and modern APIs.

Each project has been organized in its own folder, with a dedicated README and source code.
The aim of this repository is to document my learning journey, showcase my skills, and create practical applications that solve real-world problems or enhance understanding of various concepts.
